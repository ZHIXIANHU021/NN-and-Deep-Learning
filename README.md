# NN-and-Deep-Learning
[Neural Network and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

This repo contains all my works for this course. All those code, assignments questions, data, and images are taken from [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning).

## Goals
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks
- Know how to implement efficient(vectorized) neural networks
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture
- Practice all these ideas in Python
